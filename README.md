It is repo that contain logs/history of me trying to solve some problems. Some of them I hope I will be able to solve and results|logs|ways here will help me in future when I will encounter same problems.

Some of this beloved problems will not be solved. As, for example, first problem published here about changing c++ compilation version in ArduinoIDE.

It repo was created for me, but I made it publical because why not?
I am not planning on using here very appropriate language, sorry folks(is someone even reading this, wtf!!!).

Sometimes I encounter complex problems that takes a lot of time, tries and searches to solve. As I meantion sometimes I solve them(even not knowing how) and sometimes I dont.
So some walkthrough may be helpfull when I will encounter same problems.

Why creating this repo and not just using StackOverflow or whatever? Becausse I havent used it for such purposes, I am scared of people and because it is about my own experince and walkthroughs.
Sometimes you find solution on StackOverflow or some c++ forum back from 2001 and guess what? It dont work! But then, just because random particle from sun hits your brain, you change one freaking thing and it starts to work on your machine!
So here I am, creating this repo and hoping I will commit here more than just one problem.

Again it personal thing that I decided to share just because(go think about meaning of YOUR life, not about my reasons). Here you can find my emotions, my personal thoughs, a lot of curse words and stupid things and e.t.c.
BTW, sorry for my bad english and typos. Originally I am not english speaker and during my passionate sessions of solving such nice and solvable problems I may be on emotions which can cause my level of english go even lower.

Have a nice day)
